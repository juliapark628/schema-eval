# schema-eval

The most relevant files will be the .md files in the reports/ folder. They contain both the graphs and the code that generated them. 

## EDA

This folder contains my initial explorations of the data. Some of these graphs were included in the final report and some were not. 

## Scripts

This folder contains any code required to transform raw excel data into an rds file more suitable for analysis. 

## Reports

This folder contains the reports that I presented to the legal aid organizations and to Stanford's Legal Design Lab.
